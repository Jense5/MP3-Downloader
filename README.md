The servers Captusi uses are changing every couple weeks or months. Most changes are minor ones, which won't affect the tool. However, big server-side changes may cause the tool to crash or unable to find content. If this is the case, please do not hesitate to post issues on [Github](http://example.com) so I can solve it as fast as possible. For more information about bugs or general questions, contact me via [Github](http://example.com) or [Twitter](http://example.com).

Note that is tool is still in beta. I will create a stable version as fast as possible, but with constantly changing servers, it is pretty hard to make a stable one. Whenever something is not working, try to update the module before taking further steps. Making sure you always have the newest version as this is very important to help debugging the tool.
