CLI to download MP3's in **supah** high quality.

#### Installation

Install it via **npm**. Make sure to update it regularly to have the latest download settings. This is ***important***! So before reporting a bug, try to update.

```
$ sudo npm install -g mp3-downloader
```

#### Description

It should be easy to use. It downloads the selected track in the current working directory. You shouldn't care about arguments, the program will figure it out itself. If you want, you can specify the download location with the `--output` option.

```
$ download avicii waiting for love
```

If it does somehow not run as desired, run it in `--verbose` mode.

This tool is still in beta, please report bugs as fast as possible.
